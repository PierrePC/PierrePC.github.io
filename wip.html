      Assumption-Lean Quantile Regression <br>
      Monday, April 24th, 1:10-1:50, MNO 1.040. </p>
      <p> <em> Quantile regression is a powerful tool for detecting varying associations across different parts of the dependent variable's distribution. However, when using quantile regression to parameterize the conditional association between an exposure and an outcome, given covariates, two potential issues are often ignored. Firstly, the exposure coefficient estimator may not converge to a meaningful quantity when the model is misspecified, and secondly, variable selection methods may induce excess uncertainty, rendering inferences overly optimistic. In this work, we address these issues by introducing a nonparametric main effect estimand that still captures the (conditional) association of interest, even when the quantile model is misspecified. This estimand is estimated using the efficient influence function under the nonparametric model, allowing for the incorporation of data-adaptive procedures such as variable selection and machine learning. Our approach provides a flexible and reliable method for detecting associations that is robust to model misspecification and excess uncertainty induced by variable selection methods. </em> </p>

      Random multi-geodesics on hyperbolic surfaces of large genus <br>
      Monday, April 17th, 1:10-1:50, MNO 1.040. </p>
      <p class="abstractButton" data-target="#collapseMingkunS23"> Abstract </p>
      <p class="collapse" id="collapseMingkunS23"> <em> On a hyperbolic surface, a closed geodesic is said to be simple if it does not intersect itself, and a multi-geodesic is a disjoint union of simple closed geodesics. In this talk, I will explain how to pick a random multi-geodesic, and present an attempt to answer the following question: what is the shape of a random multi-geodesic on a hyperbolic surface of large genus? We will see that it looks like a random permutation, and in particular, the average lengths of its first three largest connected components are approximately, 75.8%, 17.1%, and 4.9%, respectively, of the total length. This is joint work with Vincent Delecroix. </em> </p>

      Riemannian geometry encoded in a Gaussian field <br>
      Monday, March 6th, 1:10-1:50, MNO 1.050. </p>
      <p class="abstractButton" data-target="#collapseMicheleS23"> Abstract </p>
      <p class="collapse" id="collapseMicheleS23"> <em> There is a one to one correspondence between Gaussian fields on a manifold and immersions of the manifold in a separable Hilbert space, up to orthogonal transformations. The Gaussian field provides a whole new language to talk about the geometry of the manifold and offers new interpretations of some things. In particular, the metric, the volume, the second fundamental form, the Levi-Civita connection and the Riemann tensors can all be described easily in terms of the Gaussian field. Moreover, the Gauss-Bonnet theorem (“the Euler characteristic equals the integral of the Pfaffian of the curvature”) can proved and generalized as a consequence of Kac-Rice formula. </em> </p>

      SOS OSSS <br>
      Monday, February 6th, 1:10-1:50, MNO 1.010. </p>
      <p class="abstractButton" data-target="#collapseGiovanniS23"> Abstract </p>
      <p class="collapse" id="collapseGiovanniS23"> <em> The OSSS inequality (O'Donnel, Saks, Servedio & Schramm, 2005) is a bound on the first absolute centered moment of random variables defined on the discrete cube (endowed with a product measure), whose proof is based on the use of stopping sets and randomized algorithms. When restricted to Boolean functions, it yields a spectacular improvement of the discrete Poincaré inequality, which is often (drastically) better than the celebrated Talgrand's \(L^1\text{–}L^2\) estimates. The OSSS inequality is at the core of the Duminil-Copin/Raoufi/Tassion “revolutionary” theory of sharp phase transitions in percolation (2017-2020), and is nowadays considered a fundamental tool by several communities. Although such a result has been adapted to a variety of situations (non-product measures and configuration spaces, for instance) several basic questions around it continue to stay open, for instance: (i) can one prove an OSSS inequality without assuming the existence of a randomized algorithm?; (ii) can one prove a genuine \(L^p\) OSSS inequality for \(p>1\)? <br>
      The aim of my talk is to state and prove the original OSSS inequality, and to illustrate some open problems surrounding it.
